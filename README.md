# Contributing
Since this is a huge task, it's basically impossible to do this on my own. Every bit of help of keeping this data up to date is very much appricated. There are a few key points then contributing.
- If you update an existing file, keep in mind to update:
    - The `<file>.updated`
    - When needed, update the status of the data in the table above.
- If you create a new filel, keep in mind to:
    - Update the `<file>.updated` with the date of the last check
    - Add an entry to the table above (alphabetical order)

The commit message I always use is as follows: "`Update - <file>` <message>". This isn't strictly needed, but it will be appricated since it keeps the commit messages nice :D
